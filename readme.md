source code to my dual spectate mod. it's messy since I have some other features in here
like a scoreboard for Reverse Tag, as well as some other feature flags that can only be
changed in code, because this mod is really unfinished lmao, but I never ended up getting
around to using it for anything so here you go

no usage instructions because it's been so long that I do not remember what the controls
were lmao, but by default it should automatically enter dual spectate mode whenever you
start a multiplayer match, but if you disable that flag in the code, it can be enabled manually
with some keybind I don't remember

player 1 defaults to first player in the lobby
player 2 defaults to second player in the lobby (their view is set to this a few seconds before the countdown to ensure it always has this order)

player 2 camera view can be changed with Ctrl+Period

the Tag Scoreboard is also enabled in the code atm but yeah

this is obviously only relevant if you're building it yourself since yeah I haven't made any releases yet

in future I might clean this up and migrate it to a BepInEx mod since I don't like centrifuge, but yeah.

atm I am not super interested in contributions to this repository, this mod was mainly made for my own purposes
and I would prefer to continue working on it myself if I feel like it needs more
